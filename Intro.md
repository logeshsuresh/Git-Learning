A lot of application have `versions` when you donwload them. 
Example : Amazon Prime Video -> Version 9.30.9
          PDF Reader Pro -> Version 2.8.81

When an application is actually built up, it is not built in one go. You first make the MVP 
(Minimum Viable Product) and then later add features.

Whenever you complete one milestone, you release a version (change the version).

You can rollback to previous versions. 

You have tools for version management & for collaborative environment.

Git -> Version Control System {
    A tool of piece of software with which you can manage versions of software.
}

VCS helps us manage different version of the application.

Github is an online tool for collaboration for Open-Sourced/Closed-Sourced softwares. Github does not do version
control for you. Online tool which harness the power of GIT.

git init -> Powers your folder to be managed by git & initializes a new empty repository. Also creates a .git 
            folder that has all the relevant logic to manage the versions of your project.
